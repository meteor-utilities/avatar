Consolidated Avatar Template Package for Meteor
-----------------------------------------------

ANNOUNCEMENT
------------

This package has been forked from @bengott's original Avatar package since it no longer seems to be maintained.

BREAKING CHANGES
----------------

In version 0.7.14 and earlier the Avatar options were overridden by assigning them directly to `Avatar.options`. You should no longer do this. Instead, you must call `Avatar.setOptions()` and pass the options that you wish to override.

The template parameters were overhauled in version 0.5.0. The `Avatar.options` object changed quite a bit in version 0.6.0 too. And make sure you note the `defaultType`/`fallbackType` changes in version 0.7.0. Basically, things are still in a state of flux (pre-1.0.0), so check for breaking changes and read the rest of the README carefully when you update the package.


Installation
------------
In your Meteor project directory, run:
```shell
$ meteor add utilities:avatar
```
Of course, you also need to add the accounts-<service> packages for the services you're using (e.g. accounts-twitter) and accounts-ui or something similar in order to add login functionality to your app.

Usage
-----
In an HTML file:
```handlebars
{{> avatar (user=<user> || userId=<userId>)
           (size="large" || "small" || "extra-small")
           (shape="rounded" || "circle")
           (class="some custom classes")
           (initials="<initials>") (bgColor="<color>") (txtColor="<color>") }}
```

That may look like a lot of options, but they are all optional. Most of the time, your HTML will look more like this:
```handlebars
{{> avatar user=this shape="circle"}}
```

Optional template parameters:
  - `user` or `userId`: Either a user object or userId string, default avatar if omitted
  - `size`: Size of the avatar, by default either "large" (80px), "small" (30px), or "extra-small" (20px), although these may be overridden and new ones defined. If no size is provided 50px is used.
  - `shape`: Used for CSS border-radius property, either "rounded" or "circle", square if omitted
  - `class`: Any custom CSS classes you'd like to define on the avatar container. The string is passed straight through to the `class` attribute on the `div` container element.
  - `initials`: Specify the initials to show for the initials avatar. The package automatically tries to determine the user's initials from profile data, but if defined, this param will override that.
  - `bgColor` and `txtColor`: Override the default colors for the initials avatar (color name or hex value string). The default colors are white (`"#FFF"`) text on a gray (`"#AAA"`) background. You could also override these default colors in your CSS if you wanted to, but this param allows you to do it directly from the template call.

Global Configuration Options
----------------------------
The package exports a global `Avatar` object which has a property named `options` (also an object). The default options provided can be overridden by calling `Avatar.setOptions()` and passing in the options that you wish to override.

***Note that `Avatar.setOptions()` must be called in both server and client code.***

  - `fallbackType`: Determines the type of fallback to use when no image can be found via linked services (Gravatar included):
    - "default image" (the default option, which will show either the image specified by defaultImageUrl, the package's default image, or a Gravatar default image).
      OR
    - "initials" (show the user's initials)
  - `defaultImageUrl`: This will replace the included package default image URL ("packages/avatar/default.png"). It can be a relative path (e.g. "images/defaultAvatar.png").
  - `gravatarDefault`: Gravatar default option to use (overrides defaultImageUrl option and included package default image URL). Options are available [here](https://secure.gravatar.com/site/implement/images/#default-image).
  - `emailHashProperty`: This property on the user object will be used for retrieving gravatars (useful when user emails are not published).
  - `customImageProperty`: If you're storing images URLs in a property on the user object, you can specify it here.
  - `cssClassPrefix`: This property is used to prefix the CSS classes of the DOM elements generated by this package.
  - `imageSizes`: This property defines the avatar sizes that are available to your project

Example usage:
- To show initials when no avatar image can be found via linked services:
```javascript
Avatar.setOptions({
  fallbackType: "initials"
});
```

- To show the included package default image, you don't need to specify any options because this is the default functionality. However, you could specify it explicitly like so:
```javascript
Avatar.setOptions({
  fallbackType: "default image"
});
```
- To show a custom default image:
```javascript
Avatar.setOptions({
  defaultImageUrl: "img/default-avatar.png" OR "http://example.com/default-avatar.png"
});
```
  ***Note that Gravatar's default option requires a publicly accessible URL, so it won't work when your app is running on localhost and you're using either the included package default image or a custom defaultImageUrl that is a relative path. It will work fine once deployed though.***

- To show one of Gravatar's default options (e.g. "identicon"):
```javascript
Avatar.setOptions({
  gravatarDefault: "identicon"
});
```
  ***Note that gravatarDefault overrides defaultImageUrl and the included package default image.***
 
- Set a value to the `cssClassPrefix` to avoid conflicts in CSS class names. Setting the property value like this:
```javascript
Avatar.setOptions({
  cssClassPrefix: 'foo'
});
```
Will assign CSS class names prefixed by 'foo', like below:
```html
<div class="foo foo-small foo-circle">
    <img class="foo-image" src="path_to_your_avatar" alt="avatar" onerror="this.style.display='none';" width="30" height="30">
    <span class="foo-initials">A</span>
</div>
```
If a `cssClassPrefix` is not set, then the default prefix 'avatar' is used for CSS class names in the rendered the HTML:
```html
<div class="avatar avatar-small avatar-circle">
    <img class="avatar-image" src="path_to_your_avatar" alt="avatar" onerror="this.style.display='none';" width="30" height="30">
    <span class="avatar-initials">A</span>
</div>
```

- If your app does not publish the user.emails object/property but publishes an email hash property instead, you can specify it like this (the Gravatar package generates a hash internally when you give it an email too; this just allows you to decouple those two steps so as not to make all your users' emails public):
```javascript
Avatar.setOptions({
  emailHashProperty: "email_hash"
});
```
  ***Note that you can use `Avatar.hash("address@email.com");` to generate an email hash as `Gravatar` do.***
 
- You may override the default avatar sizes, or create new ones, by overriding the `imageSizes` option:
```javascript
Avatar.setOptions({
  imageSizes: {
    'large': 80,
    'mySize': 40
  }  
});
```

Test App
--------
The app used to test Avatar is available here:  
https://github.com/bengott/avatar-tester

How the package chooses an avatar
---------------------------------
Given a user object or userId string, Avatar will retrieve the user's image with the following priority:
  1. The user object's custom image URL (stored in the property defined by `Avatar.options.customImageProperty`)
  2. Twitter
  3. Facebook
  4. Google
  5. GitHub
  6. Instagram
  7. Linkedin
  8. Gravatar, which will try to return an avatar matching the user's email address/hash. If it can't find one, then:
    - If `Avatar.options.fallbackType` is "initials", Gravatar returns a 404 (Not Found) response.
    - Else,
      - If `Avatar.options.gravatarDefault` is valid, Gravatar will return a default image (e.g. an identicon).
      - If `Avatar.options.gravatarDefault` is invalid or undefined, Gravatar will return either the image referenced by `Avatar.options.defaultImageUrl` or the included default image.
  9. If no image can be retrieved, the user's initials will be shown.

**Required Fields/Properties on the User Object**

Since fields in `user.services` contain security info, it's often wise to restrict access to those in publications, e.g.:
```javascript
UsersCollection.find({ /* query */ }, {
  fields: {
    //...
    "services.facebook.id" : true
    //...
  }
});
```

Fields used to get avatar image (one per service):
```javascript
"services.twitter.profile_image_url_https"
"services.facebook.id"
"services.google.picture"
"services.github.username"
"services.instagram.profile_picture"
"services.linkedin.pictureUrl"
```

Fields used to form initials (if needed):
```javascript
 "profile.firstName"
 "profile.lastName"
 "profile.familyName"
 "profile.secondName"
 "profile.name"
```

**Linked Services/Accounts:**
By default, the Meteor accounts system creates a separate user account for each service you login with. In order to merge those accounts together, you'd need to use a package like [accounts-meld](https://atmospherejs.com/splendido/accounts-meld) or [link-accounts](https://atmospherejs.com/bozhao/link-accounts). In the future, the plan is to add UI to allow the user to select which avatar they want to use and/or upload their own image.
